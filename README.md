SkyAdventures
=============

My unfinished 2D platformer game
Using:
- nape physics
- own entity based component engine
- own debug console
- threads emulation
- Tiled for level editing
- my test in art

All assets connected thru the swc. Vector rasterized into the bitmap data. 
Have cachedata to avoid unnecessary calculations (not finished)

It's a IntelliJIdea project. My favorite IDE.

~ - Game in console
wasd - for moving
